Implement
	Save/Load machine data to song
	CaptureOnSlotChange
	RestoreOnSlotChange
	RestoreOnSongLoad

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
