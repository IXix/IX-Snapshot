Update docs
	Changed order of buttons in main tab to match those in manager
	Move info to a separate tab
	Ctrl+Alt+Leftclick on "Clear all" and "Clear selected" buttons in any tab clears properties from all slots. Will always prompt.
	Added "Remove from all slots" to treeview item context menus. Will always promt.
	Smoothing:
		Global params Smoothing and Smoothing Units.
		Warn about CPU with many params

Improve information shown on info tab
	Show sizes for all slots

Undo/redo would be useful

Inertia for parameter changes
	Expose transition shape to the UI
	Allow specific params to override the default time set by the machine params.

	Would be nice to have per-parameter smoothing times as well as a default time.
		Make a Dictionary<key/*param*/, value /*CSmoothingInfo*/>
			key same as for param values for easy lookup
		A 'smoothing options' pop-up dialog in the treeviews
			units - dropdown (ticks, beats, samples, ms, sec, minutes)
			count - numeric field, or maybe allow expressions using regex, similar to Magic
			override default - checkbox
			shape selector - dropdown

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Icons

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Manager interface
	Editing values would be nice.
		Would have to make sure input was properly validated for the selected property
		Machine data values would have to be non-editable

	Morphing?

Mapping dialog
	Would be nice if we could swap the content to display note names or controller names depending on which was selected

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
