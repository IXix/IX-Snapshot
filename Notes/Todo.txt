Save/load selection seems broken
	seems to only save checked state if slot has data or something.
	same is true of smoothing data, not saved if no values stored
	Would prefer selection to always be saved

MIDI Mapping:
	Mapping view
		DataGrid doesn't update when MidiMap is changed

Undo/redo
	Basic system already exists for when property dialog is cancelled. Wouldn't take much to adapt it.
	
Find a way to include machine connections in snapshots.
	Have a look at how wde does it in his mixer console

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Morphing
	Ideally in the manager tab. Don't want to have to set up more treeviews.
	Need to think of a way to morph a third slot between the A and B slot values.
		Perhaps target the active slot? That would make sense as you could test the morphed values.
		Suggests a requirement for "Apply on morph" option in UI

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
