RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Manager interface
	Editing values would be nice.
		Would have to make sure input was properly validated for the selected property
		Machine data values would have to be non-editable

	Morphing?

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all snapshot slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)

Inertia for parameter changes
	Would need to interpolate values and fire them off in Work(). Not sure how best to approach it.
	There's no Tick() so can't interpolate every tick
	Could we use a timer or a worker thread?

Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
