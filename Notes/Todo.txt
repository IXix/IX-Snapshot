An indicator in the treeview to show if a property has smoothing defined

MIDI Mapping:
	Actions which work on selected properties
		Add option to remember current selection at time of mapping or use whatever is selected when the action is triggered
			Not as simple as first thought. Needs significant rewrite of the mapping system.
				Dictionary<Action, UInt32> _midiMapping; // _midiMapping[Method] = code
				...would have to become...
				Dictionary<UInt32, Dictionary<Action, HashSet<CPropertyBase>> _midiMapping; // _midiMapping[code][Method] = GetSelection();
				...which is a bit hideous plus we want to choose whether to keep/clear existing values when capturing so...
					class CMidiAction
					{
						CMachineSnapshot m_targetSlot;
						Action m_action;
						Hashset<CPropertyBase> m_selection;
						bool m_clearExisting;

						void Trigger()
						{
							m_targetSlot.tempSelection = m_selection;			<- Yuk
							m_targetSlot.tempClearExisting = m_clearExisting;   <- Yuk
							m_action();
						};
					};
					Dictionary<UInt32, CMidiAction> _midiMapping;
					
				...which would be...
					_midiMapping[code] = new CMidiAction(Action, GetSelection, clearExisting)
				...and to fire...
					CMidiAction a = _midiMapping[code].Trigger();

				To get rid of the yuk in Trigger() we'd need to work out how to have an Action with arguments.
					I think an Action is basically a simple delegate so perhaps it wouldn't be difficult
					But the various commands have different numbers of arguments
						we'd need to change the method lookup signature depending on the command string
						That might mean we'd need multiple variants of CMidiAction with different delegates
							eg. MidiCaptureAction, MidiRestoreAction, MidiPurgeAction etc.

				All this will also impact the loading of existing songs as the mappings need to be restored
					Also bear in mind that when trying to implement a warning if MIDI event is already mapped, the Action
					that was added to MidiMap when loading did not match the Action produced by the lookup. May not matter in new imp.

		Some way to update the selection memeory too.

	Warn when MIDI message is already mapped to something else
		Might want to have one MIDI message do multiple actions but some would cause conflict eg. Capture and Clear on same slot
		Might want same in main UI

Undo/redo
	Basic system already exists for when property dialog is cancelled. Wouldn't take much to adapt it.

Include MIDI mapping data on info tab
	
Find a way to include machine connections in snapshots.
	Have a look at how wde does it in his mixer console

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Morphing
	Ideally in the manager tab. Don't want to have to set up more treeviews.
	Need to think of a way to morph a third slot between the A and B slot values.
		Perhaps target the active slot? That would make sense as you could test the morphed values.
		Suggests a requirement for "Apply on morph" option in UI

Mapping dialog
	Would be nice if we could swap the content to display note names or controller names depending on which was selected

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
