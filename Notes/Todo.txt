RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Update TreeView item DisplayName on capture/clear

Manager interface
	Implement display of captured values
		This will make it easier to see whether copying A to B is working.

	A/B panes should individually be able to capture, clear, purge etc. same as the main interface
	

	Should we allow restore of A/B as well?

	Editing values would be nice.
		Would have to make sure input was properly validated for the selected property
		Machine data values would have to be non-editable

	Set current slot (maybe an "Activate" button for each pane)
		Setting A/B as the current slot would enable MIDI control

	Copy/paste/duplicate/clear slots

	Morphing?

Need to enable renaming of slots
	Doing so via the slot combo was glitchy before. It was ditched because we didn't want to spend ages fixing it.
	Time to try again.

Inertia for parameter changes
	Would need to interpolate values and fire them off in Work(). Not sure how best to approach it.
	There's no Tick() so can't interpolate every tick
	Could we use a timer or a worker thread?

Filter visibility of properties in the treeview somehow.

Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
