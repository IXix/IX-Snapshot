Update docs
	Changed order of buttons in main tab to match those in manager
	Move info to a separate tab
	Removed LOAD button from manager. Now use Ctrl+click "SetActive" to activate and restore simultaneously.
	Ctrl+Alt+Leftclick on "Clear all" and "Clear selected" buttons in any tab clears properties from all slots. Will always prompt.
	Added "Remove from all slots" to treeview item context menus. Will always promt.
	Added notes for slots
	Smoothing:
		Global params Smoothing, Smoothing Units, Smoothing Shape.
		Warn about CPU with many params
		Property context menu items
		Property settings dialog

BUG: (In 1.2 release) MIDI Mapping specific slots is broken
	Two problems:
		1. The method lookups are looking for uniquely named methods like "Capture"
			but we overloaded most of them so "Capture" matches more than one method.
		2. The mapping uses an Action to fire the method but Action requires a method with no params ie. Capture()
			but we adjusted most of them to pass in a set of properties and possibly other options
	Potential fix:
		Create zero param overloads of the necessary methods that somehow call the parameterised versions
			Would need to get the selection from the machine to pass into the method
			Would also need to ensure the method lookup explicitly wants a method with zero params for Action compatibility

Property Settings dialog:
	Input validation
		value box needs to enforce parmaeter range
			if user enters a bad value, it's rejected by the setter but the box continues to display the bad value
	TODO:
		Icons for smoothing value clear buttons
			Have them switch from greyed X to red X based on 
		Slider as well as text field for value?
			Not appropriate for attributes. Maybe at some point dialog content could depend on property type?
		Tooltips

Undo/redo would be useful
	Basic system already exists for when property dialog is cancelled. Wouldn't take much to adapt it.

Include MIDI mapping data on info tab
	
Find a way to include machine connections in snapshots.
	Have a look at how wde does it in his mixer console

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Icons

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Morphing?

Mapping dialog
	Would be nice if we could swap the content to display note names or controller names depending on which was selected

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
