Using Buzz presets for storage since it's all there already but can't use Preset.Apply()
to restore if we want control over what gets restored. Can we inherit our own class
from Preset and implement our own methods?

Slots

Save/Load machine data to song

Three state checkboxes on Machine and Groups
	Checked if all children checked, unchecked if no children checked, indeterminate if some children checked

Checkboxes to include/exclude params from store/restore

Custom preset class to allow excluding unwanted parameters
	Look at how BuzzGUI.Preset works.
	Might be able to inherit from it and use a dictionary<param,bool> to control what gets stored , not sure.

Automatic behaviour checkboxes

Styling of list items based on GotState and UseData

Method of setting UseData from listbox
