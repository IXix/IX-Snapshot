BUGS:
	Main Slot combo doesn't follow slot param change
	Also capture non-active slot then switching to that slot via the param, combo doesn't show the slot name in bold

Update docs
	Changed order of buttons in main tab to match those in manager
	Move info to a separate tab
	Removed LOAD button from manager. Now use Ctrl+click "SetActive" to activate and restore simultaneously.
	Ctrl+Alt+Leftclick on "Clear all" and "Clear selected" buttons in any tab clears properties from all slots. Will always prompt.
	Added "Remove from all slots" to treeview item context menus. Will always promt.
	Added notes for slots
	Smoothing:
		Global params Smoothing, Smoothing Units, Smoothing Shape.
		Warn about CPU with many params
		Property context menu items
		Property settings dialog

UI
	Buttons for actions which work on slected properties should be disabled when nothing is selected

Smoothing shape param descriptions

MIDI Mapping:
	Actions which work on selected properties
		Add option to remember current selection at time of mapping or use whatever is selected when the action is triggered
			Add a HashSet<CPropertyBase> to the CMachineSnapshot to remember the selection
		Some way to update the selection memeory too.
	Warn when MIDI message is already mapped to something else
		Might want to have one MIDI message do multiple actions but some would cause conflict eg. Capture and Clear on same slot
	Option to clear/keep existing values when capturing
		Might want same in main UI

Undo/redo
	Basic system already exists for when property dialog is cancelled. Wouldn't take much to adapt it.

Include MIDI mapping data on info tab
	
Find a way to include machine connections in snapshots.
	Have a look at how wde does it in his mixer console

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Icons
	Property dialog smoothing clear buttons and filter text clear buttons can use same icon
	Manager copy buttons
	Selection manipulation buttons
	Action buttons?
		Buttons are big enough to have text plus icon. Icons might help avoid incorrect button presses.

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Morphing
	Ideally in the manager tab. Don't want to have to set up more treeviews.
	Need to think of a way to morph a third slot between the A and B slot values.
		Perhaps target the active slot? That would make sense as you could test the morphed values.
		Suggests a requirement for "Apply on morph" option in UI

Mapping dialog
	Would be nice if we could swap the content to display note names or controller names depending on which was selected

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
