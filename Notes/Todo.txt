Test *everything*

Info tab
	Update grid on capture etc.
	Make name and notes editable
	Add MIDI info

Update docs
	Selection memory for slot specific actions
	Changes to "Selection follows slot" behaviour
	Options for slot specific actions
	MIDI tab
	MIDI binding buttons
	MIDI mapping dialog
	MIDI conflict warning
	Info tab

CPropertyBase has two lots of property changed style code, a bit sucky and confusing.
	Consolidate into a single INotifyPropertyChanged style system so it's like everything else
		This is part of a wider problem that the whole system of UI notification is confused and messy
		Really need to scrap it all and start again with improved knowledge and understanding

Update file format in comments, old versions too.

MIDI mapping
	Context menu for selected cells might be nice:
		Single row:
			Edit
			Remove
		Multiple rows:
			Remove

Undo/redo
	Basic system already exists for when property dialog is cancelled. Wouldn't take much to adapt it.
	
Find a way to include machine connections in snapshots.
	Have a look at how wde does it in his mixer console

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Morphing
	Ideally in the manager tab. Don't want to have to set up more treeviews.
	Need to think of a way to morph a third slot between the A and B slot values.
		Perhaps target the active slot? That would make sense as you could test the morphed values.
		Suggests a requirement for "Apply on morph" option in UI

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
