Implement UI for MIDI mappings
	Needs a dialog
		Text or title showing action being mapped eg. "Slot 4 Capture"
		Channel combo including "Any"
		Event type = note-on, note-off or CC
		Value Edit/spinner constrained 0-127, disabled if type != CC
		Populate/store dialog settings in CMidiEvent objects
			Need one object for every mappable action
				Snapshot already has them for Capture/Restore but might need a rethink as we'll need them for
				all the machine level actions too and might want to add CaptureMissing etc. to snapshots

Selecting slot from combo dropdown breaks slot name in combo edit field

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Some kind of slot manager
	Tab or separate window? Probably tab.
	Display slot names and sizes.
	Maybe display stored values?
		Maybe even edit values?
	Set current slot
	Copy/paste/duplicate/clear slots

Filter visibility of properties in the treeview somehow.

Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
