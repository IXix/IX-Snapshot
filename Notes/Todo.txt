RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Manager interface
	Editing values would be nice.
		Would have to make sure input was properly validated for the selected property
		Machine data values would have to be non-editable

	Set current slot (maybe an "Activate" button for each pane)
		Setting A/B as the current slot would enable MIDI control

	Morphing?

Context menu for treeview items
	Implement menus for property groups
		Apply action to all children
	Remove from all snapshot slots?
	Implement for manager A/B panes when working well in main view
	Copy from left/right for manager?

Inertia for parameter changes
	Would need to interpolate values and fire them off in Work(). Not sure how best to approach it.
	There's no Tick() so can't interpolate every tick
	Could we use a timer or a worker thread?

Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
