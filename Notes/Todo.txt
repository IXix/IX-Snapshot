Prevent treeview resizing to fit content and add scrollbar

Slots
	Either:
		a. Convert stored values into arrays of values
			Avoids duplication of machine state structures
		b. Add a MachineState for each slot
			Easier but less efficient.

Save/Load machine data to song

Add option to capture/clear on check/uncheck property

Implement code for automatic behaviour checkboxes

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing

Data item should display the data size (possibly both stored size and machine sizes) so we know whether we're storing 16GB of data

Info readout seems wrong. Total number of properties doesn't match num selected when everything selected.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
