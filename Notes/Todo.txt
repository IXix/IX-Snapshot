Selecting slot from combo dropdown breaks slot name in combo edit field

Rework things so that slots are contained in a List<MachineSnapshot>
	Should make a bunch of stuff less complicated.
	All the current IPropertyState stuff can stay as that's useful for the treeview.
	Individual value storage and all the capture/restore/clear etc. methods can go
	GotValue would need to be pulled from the current snapshot somehow

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Some kind of slot manager
	Tab or separate window? Probably tab.
	Display slot names and sizes.
	Maybe display stored values?
		Maybe even edit values?
	Set current slot
	Copy/paste/duplicate/clear slots

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
