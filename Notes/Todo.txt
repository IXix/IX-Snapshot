Implement
	Save/Load machine data to song
		slot names
		MachineState
			name
			Properties
				name
				selected
				slot values

	CaptureOnSlotChange
	RestoreOnSlotChange
		Working but a bit glitchy, possibly because we're issuing tons of Actions
		Look at packaging all the patram/data/attribute changes into a single event
			Rapid slot changes can lead to Buzz trying to apply a value
			from the wrong source so we need to fix the values before sending


	RestoreOnSongLoad

Some kind of slot manager
	Tab or separate window? Probably tab.
	Display slot names and sizes.
	Maybe display stored values?
		Maybe even edit values?
	Set current slot
	Copy/paste/duplicate/clear slots

Enable Fixupdate of slot param when selecting from the combo
	Causes deadlocks now.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
