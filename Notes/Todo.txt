Update docs
	Changed order of buttons in main tab to match those in manager
	Move info to a separate tab
	Removed LOAD button from manager. Now use Ctrl+click "SetActive" to activate and restore simultaneously.
	Ctrl+Alt+Leftclick on "Clear all" and "Clear selected" buttons in any tab clears properties from all slots. Will always prompt.
	Added "Remove from all slots" to treeview item context menus. Will always promt.
	Added notes for slots
	Smoothing:
		Global params Smoothing, Smoothing Units, Smoothing Shape.
		Warn about CPU with many params
		Property context menu items
		Property settings dialog

Property Settings dialog:
	TODO:
		Smoothing controls should show inherited values
			Need to add 'inherited' combo item.
			Might need an int? to int converter (null -> -1) for that.
				Can a converter do the 'add one for display, sub one for set' thing?
		Slider as well as text field for value?
			Not appropriate for attributes. Maybe at some point dialog content could depend on property type?
		Shape menu
			Needs images
		Tooltips
		Style: Can we use some kind of shared stylesheet across all windows for consistency?

Property context menu Clear doesn't update the tree properly

Undo/redo would be useful

Include MIDI mapping data on info tab
	
Find a way to include machine connections in snapshots.
	Have a look at how wde does it in his mixer console

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Icons

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Manager interface
	Editing values would be nice.
		Would have to make sure input was properly validated for the selected property
		Machine data values would have to be non-editable

	Morphing?

Mapping dialog
	Would be nice if we could swap the content to display note names or controller names depending on which was selected

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
