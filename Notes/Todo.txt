RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Some kind of slot manager
	Commander style two pane interface
	Each pane is like the machines pane in the main interface but needs to adjust item properties based on the selected slot for the pane.
	Need to update the manager panels when SelA/SelB change
	Need to sync the expanded property across the two panes
		CTreeViewItem.IsExpanded needs to link to some property of the CMachineStateVM (probably)
		Need to add an Expanded property somewhere.
			Sensible place would be in groups as single properties can't be expanded.
				Put the event handler stuff in a group base class
	Selection in manager needs to be separate from selection in main view
		Currently IsChecked is linked to CPropertyBase.Selected
		Need to either store it in CMachneStateVM or add A/B selectedness to CPropertyBase
	Boldness of combo text for A/B slot select isn't working properly
		Works to an extent but behaviour isn't right
		Should be bold only when the relevant slot has data

	Maybe display stored values?
		Maybe even edit values?
	Set current slot (maybe an "Activate" button for each pane)
	Copy/paste/duplicate/clear slots
	Morphing?

Inertia for parameter changes
	Would need to interpolate values and fire them off in Work(). Not sure how best to approach it.
	There's no Tick() so can't interpolate every tick
	Could we use a timer or a worker thread?

Filter visibility of properties in the treeview somehow.

Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
