Inertia for parameter changes
	Basic system is in place but sending lots of changes causes Buzz UI to freeze until param changes are complete
		Sending in subticks was very bad. Sending once per tick is okay but breaks down when there are hundreds of params.
		Need to investigate using a worker thread to send param changes rather than pushing them to the main thread.

	Would be nice to have per-parameter smoothing times as well as a default time.
		Make a Dictionary<key/*param*/, value /*CSmoothingInfo*/>
			key same as for param values for easy lookup
		A 'smoothing options' pop-up dialog in the treeviews
			units - dropdown (ticks, beats, bars, ms, sec, minutes)
			count - numeric field, or maybe allow expressions using regex, similar to Magic
			override default - checkbox
			maybe shape options if we're feeling fancy
		Default smoothing can be exposed as machine params and UI controls
			Might need to move the various option checkboxboxes to a new tab to free up space

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?

Icons

Store snapshots on disk
	Probably xml although not sure how the machine data will work with that.

Manager interface
	Editing values would be nice.
		Would have to make sure input was properly validated for the selected property
		Machine data values would have to be non-editable

	Morphing?

Mapping dialog
	Would be nice if we could swap the content to display note names or controller names depending on which was selected

Context menu for treeview items
	Remove from all snapshot slots?
	Set all same properties to value?
		Copy from selected property to any other instances of the same property (same machine)


Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort of indicator graphic instead.

Multiple selection in treeview
	Possibly by adapting https://chrigas.blogspot.com/2014/08/wpf-treeview-with-multiple-selection.html
