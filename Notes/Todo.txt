Slot names

Slot size and total size

Implement
	Save/Load machine data to song
	CaptureOnSlotChange
	RestoreOnSlotChange
		Might not be possible to do this from a parameter.
		Getting an exception saying another thread owns the thing. See if there's anything like mi::Lock() in BuzzGUI

	RestoreOnSongLoad

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
