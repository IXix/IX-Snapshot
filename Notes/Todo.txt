Need thorough testing outside of debug to avoid persistant random crashes.

RestoreOnSlotChange works but can it be optimised?



Manager interface
	Need to sync the scroll position in A/B panes	

	Editing values would be nice.
		Would have to make sure input was properly validated for the selected property
		Machine data values would have to be non-editable

	Set current slot (maybe an "Activate" button for each pane)
		Setting A/B as the current slot would enable MIDI control

	Morphing?

Need to enable renaming of slots
	Doing so via the slot combo was glitchy before. It was ditched because we didn't want to spend ages fixing it.
	Time to try again.

Would like properties with values to be expanded when the slot becomes active in one of the treeviews.

Inertia for parameter changes
	Would need to interpolate values and fire them off in Work(). Not sure how best to approach it.
	There's no Tick() so can't interpolate every tick
	Could we use a timer or a worker thread?

Filter visibility of properties in the treeview somehow.

Some way of setting default property selection for individual machines would be nice

Select new machines option could be broken into separate options for attributes, globals. track and data.

Styling of list items based on whether a value is stored/not stored/missing
	Currently properties that have stored values are bold. Might be nice to have some sort if indicator graphic instead.

Selecting (not checking) items in the treeview is very sluggish and doesn't work for mouse-clicks
	Probably fires loads of unused events or something.
