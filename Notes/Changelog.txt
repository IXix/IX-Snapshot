	Improved GUI control size stretch/fit etc.
	Removed MachineState.InputStates
		Apparently machine input parameters (amp + pan) can't be set
	Attribute now shown in treeview (duh)
	Fixed a few bugs related to Purge
	Implemented display of machine data size
	Data item is no longer added if machine has no data
	Fixed MachineState being needlessly generated for Snapshot
	Prevent items with no children being checked in UpdateTreeCheck()
	Implemented SelectNewMachines and RestoreOnStop
	Added base class PropertyBase to reduce some of the code duplication
	Started trying to implement slots
		Surprisingly my initial stab seems to work but Selected needs to be a
		per-slot property. Probably want to use a class to combine Selected
		and Value in a Slot object so we can have m_slots[128].
		Can't call it Slot though as it will clash with the Slot property.

	Track params are now selectable per track.
	Implemented info display

	Overhaul of treeview related stuff
	Treeview checkboxes working properly although they don't actually do anything yet
		Need to figure out how to connect the state objects. Might need another overhaul :(

	Getting things going. Starting to look like something that might eventually work.
	Trying to work out save/load
