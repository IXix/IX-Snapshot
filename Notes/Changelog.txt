	Fixing stuff that was broken

2021.09.11

	Slot names in combo appear bold if slot has data

2021.09.10

		Moved ToSize() method into a new class so we can use it more generally

	Fixed MachineState being needlessly generated for Snapshot
	Prevent items with no children being checked in UpdateTreeCheck()
	Implemented SelectNewMachines and RestoreOnStop
	Added base class PropertyBase to reduce some of the code duplication
	Started trying to implement slots

2021.09.03

2021.09.30
