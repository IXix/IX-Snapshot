    <h1>IX Snapshot 1.2</h1>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <p>Store and restore combinations of machine properties. Unlike Peer State, IX Snapshot can capture a machine's internal state data, allowing you to store properties that are not exposed as parameters or attributes.</p>

    <h3><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h3>
    <p>Copy "IX Snapshot.NET.dll" and this file to your Generators folder.</p>

    <h3><a name="Parameters">Machine Parameters</a></h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Name</b></td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Slot</td>
            <td>Selects the active slot. The active slot's state is shown in the main treeview.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3><a name="GUI">GUI</a></h3>
    <p>Snapshot has a graphical interface incorporated into the machine parameters window. The window can be resized horizontally to give more room for the treeview controls, but resizing vertically is currently not possible.</p>
    <p>The controls are organised into two sections, 'Main' and 'Manage', which can be selected using the tab controls at the top of the interface. </p>

    <h3><a name="PatchTab">Main tab - Treeview controls</a></h3>

            <td>
                <p>The treeview shows all of the machines in the Buzz machine view and their properties. Use the checkboxes to select which properties will be affected by the action buttons. Properties that have stored values in the active slot are shown in bold and the value is dispayed to the right of the property name.</p>
                <p>Right-clicking an item will bring up a context menu which will allow you to manipulate that item (and it's children), regardless of whether its checkbox is selected.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Snapshot cannot manipulate machine connection parameters such as amp and pan, so these will not be displayed.</p>

    <h3><a name="SlotControls">Main tab - Slot controls</a></h3>

    <h3><a name="ManagerTab">Manager tab</a></h3>
    <p>The manager tab contains two sets of controls similar to those in the main tab. The controls beneath the treeviews operate on the selected properties in the appropriate view, while the controls in the central strip perform operations that involve both sides. The two treeviews are synchronised to show the same properties, so expanding/selecting an item on one side will automatically do the same on the other. Similarly, using the property filter controls will affect both sides simultaneously.</p>
    <h3>Manager tab - Treeviews and slot controls</h3>
    <p>The controls for the treeviews are the same as those in the main tab, with the exception that the slot dropdowns will not set the selected slot to be the active slot. To activate the slot, use the set/load buttons.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Control</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>

        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Set</td>
            <td>Set the relevant slot to be the active slot (allowing MIDI operations). If <a href="#MainOptions">"Restore on slot change",/a> is selected, the slot values will be restored.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Load</td>
            <td>Set the relevant slot to be the active slot (allowing MIDI operations) and restore all value.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Manager tab - Central controls</h3>
    <p>The central controls, arranged vertically between the two treeviews, perform operations involving both visible slots. Due to limited space, the buttons labels aren't very descriptive but each control has a tooltip explaining its purpose..'</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Control</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>

        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Copy to left</td>
            <td>Copies selected property values from the right slot to the left. If an empty property is copied, the corresponding value in the destination slot will be cleared.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Copy to right</td>
            <td>As above but the other way round.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">All button</td>
            <td>Selects all properties in both treeviews.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">None button</td>
            <td>Deselects all properties in both treeviews.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Invert button</td>
            <td>Inverts the property selection in both treeviews.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Left button</td>
            <td>Selects only properties that contain values on the left side.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Right button</td>
            <td>Selects only properties that contain values on the right side.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3><a name="MIDI">MIDI</a></h3>
    <p>Right-clicking a buttons in the main view will bring up a dialog allowing you to bind that button action to a MIDI event.</p>
    <p>When the MIDI event is recieved, Snapshot will perform the specified action (capture, restore, etc.) on whichever slot happens to be active at the time.</p>
    <p>If you hold CTRL when right-clicking the button, you can bind a MIDI event specifically to the active slot, allowing you to manipulate that slot even when it is no longer active.</p>
    <p>Here are the controls available in the MIDI pop-up:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Control</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Type</td>
            <td>Select whether you wish to bind to a Note-on, Note-off or Controller event.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Channel</td>
            <td>Select the MIDI channel to use when listening for the event.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Note/Controller</td>
            <td>Select which note or controller message you wish to listen for.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Controller Value</td>
            <td>If listening for a controller message, which specific value to respond to.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Learn</td>
            <td>When clicked, Snapshot will listen for MIDI events and populate the dialog controls automatically.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Okay</td>
            <td>Accept the dialog settings and add the specified MIDI event to the internal MIDI map.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Cancel</td>
            <td>Discard the dialog settings without changing the internal MIDI map.</td>
        </tr>
