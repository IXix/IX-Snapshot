    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <p>Store and restore combinations of machine properties. Unlike Peer State, IX Snapshot can capture a machine's internal state data, allowing you to store properties that are not exposed as parameters or attributes.</p>

    <h3 id="Installation">Installation</a></h3>
    <p>Copy "IX Snapshot.NET.dll" and this file to your Generators folder.</p>

    <h3 id="GUI">GUI</a></h3>
    <p>Snapshot has a graphical interface incorporated into the machine parameters window. The window can be resized horizontally to give more room for the treeview controls, but resizing vertically is currently not possible.</p>
    <p>The controls are organised into two sections, 'Main' and 'Manage', which can be selected using the tab controls at the top of the interface. There is also a third tab which is used to display information about the state of the machine.</p>

    </table>

    <h3 id="ManagerTab">Manager tab</a></h3>
    <p>The manager tab contains two sets of controls similar to those in the main tab. The controls beneath the treeviews operate on the selected properties in the appropriate view, while the controls in the central strip perform operations that involve both sides. The two treeviews are synchronised to show the same properties, so expanding/selecting an item on one side will automatically do the same on the other. Similarly, using the property filter controls will affect both sides simultaneously.</p>
    <h3>Manager tab - Treeviews and slot controls</h3>
    <p>The controls for the treeviews are the same as those in the main tab, with the exception that the slot dropdowns will not set the selected slot to be the active slot. To activate the slot, use the activate button.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Control</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Activate button</td>
            <td>Set the relevant slot to be the active slot. If <a href="#MainOptions">"Restore on slot change"</a> is selected, or if you CTRL+Click the button, the slot values will be restored.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Manager tab - Central controls</h3>
    <p>The central controls, arranged vertically between the two treeviews, perform operations involving both visible slots. Due to limited space, the buttons labels aren't very descriptive but each control has a tooltip explaining its purpose..'</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Control</b></td>

        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Select right values</td>
            <td>Selects only properties that contain values on the right side.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="Info">Info Tab</a></h3>
    <p>Shows information about properties and memory usage. Snapshots can grow to use significant amounts of memory if you capture the machine data for complex VST instruments.</p>

    <h3 id="MIDI">MIDI</a></h3>
    <p>Right-clicking a buttons in the main view will bring up a dialog allowing you to bind that button action to a MIDI event. When that MIDI event is recieved, Snapshot will perform the specified action (capture, restore, etc.) on whichever slot happens to be active at the time.</p>
    <p>If you hold CTRL when right-clicking the button, you can bind a MIDI event <i>specifically</i> to the current active slot, allowing you to manipulate that slot <b>even when it is no longer active.</b></p>
    <p>Here are the controls available in the MIDI pop-up:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Control</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Type</td>
            <td>Select whether you wish to bind to a Note-on, Note-off or Controller event.</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Select which note or controller message you wish to listen for.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Discard the dialog settings without changing the internal MIDI map.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="PropertyDialog">Property Dialog</a></h3>
    <p>Double-clicking a property in the treeview will open the Property Dialog, or you can access it via the treeview item context menu. Use the Property Dialog to set/clear/restore the value and define specific smoothing settings for each individual property.</p>
    <p>If you access the Property Dialog for a <i>group</i> of properties, changes will apply to all child properties of that group. You can capture/restore/clear values and edit smoothing settings but you cannot manually enter a stored value. Please note that opening the dialog may be slow if there are many properties in the group. This is because Snapshot temporarily stores the values of all affected properties so that everything can be restored correctly if the dialog is cancelled.</p>
    <p>The Property Dialog features the following controls:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell"><b>Control</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>

        <tr>
            <td class="leftCell">Stored value field</td>
            <td>Displays the raw stored value for the property, if one has been captured. You can enter a value manually if you unlock the field.</td>

            <td class="leftCell">Cancel</td>
            <td>Close the dialog and discard all changes. Stored values and the target property will be reset to whatever values they had before the dialog was opened.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="Smoothing">Smoothing</h3>
    <p>Snapshot 1.3 adds the ability to slowly transition parameter values when restoring from a slot. Smoothing can be set using the parameters in the machine parameter window and can also be set individually for any specific property. Properties which do not define their own smoothing inherit their values from their parent groups, and ultimately from the Snapshot machine. Inheritance is separate for each of the three smoothing values (count, units and shape) allowing flexible control over how stored values are applied when restoring from a slot.</p>
    <p>Please note that <i>timing for smoothing is only approximate</i> as it is not possible to set large numbers of parameters in the Buzz audio thread (doing so causes Buzz to freeze). Because Snapshot can potentially set hundreds of parameters at a time, it is necessary to do the work in a separate thread and precise timing cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3>
    <p>Please be aware that the GUI may be sluggish during capture/restore/clear operations if there are very many properties involved.</p>
    <p>Another thing to consider is that the Data property of VST instruments can be quite large, so please be wary if capturing VSTs. Snapshot stores all of the state information in RAM and I do not know what will happen if all the RAM is used up.</p>
